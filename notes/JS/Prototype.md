The _Prototype_ Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype - or example - object. The Prototype pattern is also referred to as the Properties pattern.\

An example of where the Prototype pattern is useful is the initialization of business objects with values that match the default values in the database. The prototype object holds the default values that are copied over into a newly created business object.

Classical languages rarely use the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript being a prototypal language uses this pattern in the construction of new objects and their prototypes.

Example: 
```js
function CustomerPrototype(proto) {
    this.proto = proto;

    this.clone = function () {
        var customer = new Customer();

        customer.first = proto.first;
        customer.last = proto.last;
        customer.status = proto.status;

        return customer;
    };
}

function Customer(first, last, status) {

    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
    this.status = status;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("name: " + this.first + " " + this.last +
            ", status: " + this.status);
    };
}

function run() {

    var proto = new Customer("n/a", "n/a", "pending");
    var prototype = new CustomerPrototype(proto);

    var customer = prototype.clone();
    customer.say();
}
```
