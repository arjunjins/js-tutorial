- Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- These patterns provide various ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- Examples include [[Singleton]], [[Factory Method]], [[Abstract Factory]], [[Builder]], [[Prototype]], and Object Pool patterns.

1. [[Abstract Factory]]
